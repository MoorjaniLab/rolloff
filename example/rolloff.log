## rolloff.  Version 625a

Computes:

sum( cov(X,Y) * delta(x)delta(y) ) / sum(delta(x)^2 delta(y)^2)

where the sums are over pairs of sites (x,y) in bin d, cov(X,Y) is
the sample covariance between random variables X and Y corresponding
to 0, 1, or 2 allele counts at sites x and y, and delta(x), delta(y)
are the allele frequency differences between ancestral populations
which we use as weights.
The resulting curve should be 2*alpha*beta*exp(-nd).
